# Channel Subscription Setup

This document explains how to set up the channel subscription feature for the Telegram bot.

## Overview

The bot now includes a channel subscription check that verifies if users are subscribed to required channels before allowing them to use the bot. When a user sends `/start`, the bot will:

1. Check if the user is subscribed to all required channels
2. If not subscribed, show a message with channel links and ask them to subscribe
3. If subscribed, proceed with the normal bot flow

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Add the following environment variables to your `.env` file:

```env
# Telegram Bot Configuration
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
TEMP_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_temp_bot_token_here
TEMP_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=your_temp_chat_id_here

# Required Channels Configuration
# Channel 1
REQUIRED_CHANNEL_1_ID=@your_channel_1
REQUIRED_CHANNEL_1_NAME=Your Channel Name 1
REQUIRED_CHANNEL_1_USERNAME=@your_channel_1

# Channel 2
REQUIRED_CHANNEL_2_ID=@your_channel_2
REQUIRED_CHANNEL_2_NAME=Your Channel Name 2
REQUIRED_CHANNEL_2_USERNAME=@your_channel_2
```

### Configuration File

The channels are configured in `config/telegram.php`. You can modify this file to:

- Add more channels
- Change the subscription message format
- Customize the bot behavior

## How It Works

### 1. Channel Subscription Check

When a user sends `/start`, the bot calls `checkChannelSubscription()` which:

- Gets the list of required channels from configuration
- For each channel, calls Telegram's `getChatMember` API
- Checks if the user's status is 'member' or 'administrator'
- Returns a list of channels the user is not subscribed to

### 2. Subscription Message

If the user is not subscribed to all required channels, the bot sends a message with:

- A warning header
- List of channels with clickable links
- Instructions to resend `/start` after subscribing

### 3. User Flow

1. User sends `/start`
2. Bot checks subscription status
3. If not subscribed: Shows subscription message with links
4. If subscribed: Proceeds with normal bot flow

## Adding More Channels

To add more channels, you can either:

### Option 1: Environment Variables
Add more environment variables following the pattern:
```env
REQUIRED_CHANNEL_3_ID=@your_channel_3
REQUIRED_CHANNEL_3_NAME=Your Channel Name 3
REQUIRED_CHANNEL_3_USERNAME=@your_channel_3
```

### Option 2: Direct Configuration
Edit `config/telegram.php` and add channels directly to the `required_channels` array:

```php
'required_channels' => [
    [
        'chat_id' => '@channel1',
        'name' => 'Channel 1',
        'username' => '@channel1'
    ],
    [
        'chat_id' => '@channel2',
        'name' => 'Channel 2',
        'username' => '@channel2'
    ],
    // Add more channels here
]
```

## Customizing Messages

You can customize the subscription messages by editing the `subscription_messages` section in `config/telegram.php`:

```php
'subscription_messages' => [
    'header' => "‚ö†Ô∏è <b>Please subscribe to the following channels:</b>\n\n",
    'footer' => "After subscribing, send /start again.",
    'channel_format' => "üì¢ <b>{name}</b>\nüîó <a href='https://t.me/{username}'>{username}</a>\n\n"
]
```

## Testing

To test the feature:

1. Set up the environment variables with real channel IDs
2. Make sure your bot is an admin in the channels you want to check
3. Send `/start` to the bot
4. If not subscribed to required channels, you should see the subscription message
5. Subscribe to the channels and send `/start` again

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Bot not admin in channel**: The bot must be an admin in the channels it's checking
2. **Invalid channel ID**: Make sure the channel IDs are correct (can be @username or numeric ID)
3. **API errors**: Check that your bot token is valid and has the necessary permissions

### Debug Mode

The bot sends debug messages to a temporary chat. Make sure `TEMP_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `TEMP_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` are set correctly to see debug information.

## Security Notes

- Keep your bot tokens secure and never commit them to version control
- The bot only checks if users are members of public channels
- Users can leave channels after the initial check, so consider periodic re-verification
